# Network Vulnerability Management Demo

This walktrough shows the process of scanning networks to discover potential vulnerabilities and exposures and then fortifying the security posture of the network by implementing various solutions

CVEs(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)



<h1>Vulnerability Scans: Initial Vulnerabilites and Exposures</h1>

<h1>Scan Report</h1>

Reports were generated from the Network Scans. Plugin IDs were consolidated by CVEs, port numbers, and IP address(some plugin ids had repeating ports, IP addresses, and CVEs).

<h1>Vulnerability Scan: 2nd Scan</h1>

This is the scan for the Iphone network after various solutions were implemented to patch and eliminate the CVEs.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

The critical and high risk CVEs were eradicated from the network. Patches for these CVEs were solutions such as updating to the latest version of the user's web browser, operating system, or appache httpd. Solutions that were difficult and/or still are yet to be implemented are to upgrade to the latest version of JQuery and the use of IP filtering to disable IP forwarding on the remote host. A txt file with html script written into the body was created to upgrade to the lastest JQuery, but when the txt file was converted to a html file, the lastest version of JQuery would not update to the web server. More research will be done into how to upgrade the JQuery version. Montly scans will elucidate the security posture and provide ways of bolstering a network's defenses.
